# Project Overview

- This project's purpose was to teach us about the fundementals of CSS by having us edit style sections with HTML files.
- In this way, we were able to learn how to use CSS directly inside a HTML file in a section called: "style" where CSS could be written.
- Overall, this project was limited to what we could change as we were only allowed to change certain blocks of code and did not have complete freedom.
- Thus, this project could have been better if we had more freedom over creating and editing this project, in this way we could have learnt more about CSS.
